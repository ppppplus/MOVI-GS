## üß† Key Features

- **Open-vocabulary semantics**: Supports arbitrary text queries with CLIP-based visual-language grounding.
- **Multi-end online updates**: Designed for streaming data from multiple views or agents.
- **Incremental Gaussian scene modeling**: Efficient and flexible updates using 3D Gaussian Splatting.
- **Modular pipeline**: Compatible with different perception backbones (e.g. SAM, DINO, CLIP).
- **Real-time capable**: Supports progressive reconstruction and semantic augmentation.
